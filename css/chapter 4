# lesson 4 unit & size

---



### absolute length unit

*   pixel



### set size

*   usually default web font size is 16px

*   usually don't set absolutely pixel number, unchangable for the browser



#### <u>rem</u>

*stands for root em, 1rem is equal to the font size of the root element*

```css
p {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

easier to suit every user



#### em

normally used in padding or margin

```css
main{
  font-size: 2rem;
  
}

p {
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

if we set the font-size to em, rem would look at the root element, which is 32px and the em would look at the parent element, so it would be 64px.

### percentage

```css
header {
  width: 50%;
}
```

the default width of that row is 50% of the page

| vh   | 1% of the viewport's height                                  |
| vmin | 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension                       |
| vmax | 1% of the viewport's larger dimension                        |

>   compare to vw, percentage might be a better choice

>   when you have a long paragraph, using vw may lead to a button scroll bar which is not good
